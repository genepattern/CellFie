The gene expression matrix can be provided in a <b>.mat</b> or <b>.csv</b> format.
<p>
For <b>.mat</b> files, you need to provide a structure variable (named e.g. "data")
containing a cell field named "genes" with NCBI Entrez gene IDs (one gene per cell)
and a double field named "value" containing a matrix with gene expression values
for each of the samples you want to evaluate (i.e. with rows corresponding to genes
and columns corresponding to samples). See available example
<a href=https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/CellFie/blob/master/test/suite/dataTest.mat>
    dataTest.mat</a>.
<p>
For <b>.csv</b> files, you need to provide an expression matrix with rows corresponding
to genes and columns corresponding to samples. The first column is the list of genes
with NCBI Entrez gene IDs and the first header row should start with "genes" and
be followed by the name of each sample present in your dataset. See the available
<a href=https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/CellFie/blob/master/test/suite/dataTest.csv>
    dataTest.csv</a>
The list of genes and associated NCBI Entrez IDs present in each reference model
can be downloaded

    here</a>.
